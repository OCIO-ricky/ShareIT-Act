# CDC Share IT Act Metadata Preview & Review Process

This repository supports the CDC implementation of the SHARE IT Act by publishing a preview of the upcoming `code.json` metadata inventory for custom-developed software. This allows CDC teams to review and validate entries before each official public release.

---

## 📋 Purpose

To help CDC developers, project teams, ADIs, and C/I/Os:
- Review repository metadata generated by the AI-based scanner
- Confirm accuracy of key fields (e.g., `Org`, `Contact Email`, `Exemption`, etc.)
- Submit corrections through pull requests for the current preview
- Ensure long-term compliance by updating `README.md` files to persist changes

---

## 🔍 How to Review Metadata

1. Open the latest **[metadata_preview_table.html](review.csv)** file published in this repository.
2. Search by:
   - Repository name
   - Org or CDC program
   - Contact email
   - Exemption status
3. Review key fields, including:
   - `Repository Name`
   - `Organization`
   - `Contact Email`
   - `Exemption`
   - `Repository URL`
   - `Version`
   - `Status`

## ✏️ How to Submit Changes

There are two complementary ways to ensure your metadata is accurate:

### 📝 1. Submit a Pull Request (PR) Directly to `code.json`

If you identify incorrect metadata in the preview:
- [Fork this repository](./CONTRIBUTING_MetadataFix_PR.md)
- Edit the `code.json` file to correct only the metadata related to your repository
- In your PR, include:
  - The repository name and Org
  - A short explanation of the correction
  - Any related metadata line numbers or fields changed
- Label your PR with `metadata-fix`
- Optionally: also update `metadata_preview_table.html` for review purposes

> ⚠️ These changes will only apply to the current release preview unless made permanent.

### 🛠️ 2. Update Your `README.md` with Metadata Markers

To ensure your corrections are **persistent across future scans**, update your repository’s `README.md` using structured override markers. These markers instruct the scanner to always pull the correct values during metadata generation.

Example:

```md
Org: NCCDPHP  
Contact Email: chronicdev@cdc.gov  
Exemption: exemptByAgencySystem  
Exemption Justification: This code is used only within CDC infrastructure and is not reusable externally.  
```

👉 See the full list of markers and usage examples in the [CDC Metadata Implementation Guide](https://docs.cdc.gov/docs/ea/codeshare/implementation-guide#readmemd-override-optional-markers).

## 🕒 Review Deadlines & Schedule

Publishing occurs quarterly, and each preview window opens **45 days prior** to the publishing date. See below for the current schedule.

Exemptions auto-assigned by the AI scanner are also listed in `exempted_log.csv`. You will only be contacted directly if your repository is flagged with a potentially incorrect exemption that lacks justification.
